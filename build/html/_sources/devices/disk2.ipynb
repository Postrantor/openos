    "\n",
    "A number of strategies are used to avoid the full penalties of seek and\n",
    "rotational delay in disks. One of these strategies is that of optimizing\n",
    "the order in which requests are performed---for instance reading sectors\n",
    "10 and 11 on a single track, in that order, would require a seek,\n",
    "followed by a rotational delay until sector 10 was available, and then\n",
    "two sectors of transfer time. However reading 11 first would require the\n",

    "was under the head), followed by a full rotation to get from section 12\n",
    "all the way back to sector 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the order in which disk reads and writes are performed in order\n",
    "to minimize disk rotations is known as *disk scheduling*, and relies on\n",
    "the fact that multitasking operating systems frequently generate\n",
    "multiple disk requests in parallel, which do not have to be completed in\n",
    "strict order. Although a single process may wait for a read or write to\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary algorithms used for disk scheduling are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first-come first-served (FCFS):** in other words no scheduling, with\n",
    "requests handled in the order that they are received.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shortest seek time first (SSTF):** this is the throughput-optimal\n",
    "strategy; however it is prone to starvation, as a stream of requests to\n",
    "nearby sections of the disk can prevent another request from being\n",
    "serviced for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SCAN:** this (and variants) are what is termed the *elevator\n",
    "algorithm* --- pending requests are served from the inside to the\n",
    "outside of the disk, then from the outside back in, etc., much like an\n",
    "elevator goes from the first floor to the highest requested one before\n",
    "going back down again. It is nearly as efficient as SSTF, while avoiding\n",
    "starvation. (With SSTF one process can keep sending requests which will\n",
    "require less seek time than another waiting request, \"starving\" the\n",
    "waiting one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated disk head scheduling algorithms exist, and could no\n",

    "mostly of interest to hard drive designers.\n",

    "### Implementing Disk Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Disk scheduling can be implemented in two ways --- in the operating\n",
    "system, or in the device itself. OS-level scheduling is performed by\n",
    "keeping a queue of requests which can be re-ordered before they are sent\n",

    "given a choice of which to complete first. This is supported as Command\n",
    "Queuing in SCSI, and in SATA as Native Command Queuing (NCQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that OS-level I/O scheduling is of limited use today for improving\n",
    "overall disk performance, as the OS has little or no visibility into the\n",
    "internal geometry of a drive. (OS scheduling is still used to merge\n",
    "adjacent requests into larger ones and to allocate performance fairly to\n",

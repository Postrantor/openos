    "The operating system software that interacts with devices must:\n",
    "- **Provide Device Independence:** Programs should be able to access any similar device without worrying about the specific device available.  For example, you should be able to read data from a floppy, hard drive, or CD-ROM without caring which device is available.  As another example, your *vim* editor should be able to work if you are connecting a dumb terminal to your computer, or if you are using an emulated terminal provided by our course staff.\n",
    "- **Handle Errors:** Many errors are transient, and we want to handle them as close to the hardware as possible.  For example, if a network is unavailable for a brief period of time, we don't want to close all the connections.  If we get an error reading a disk block, the OS might try re-reading assuming that there was a transient failure, or correct the error using some form of error correcting code.\n",
    "- **Support synchronous interfaces:** In reality, all devices interact with the OS asynchronously, where some character appears from a terminal when a user hits a key, or a network packet arrives when clients make new requests to a server.  On the other hand, generally the programming interfaces users have are synchronous, for example, using a ```read``` to a network socket or file system.  The OS keeps translates between the blocking calls by applications and the innate events that come in from devices.\n",
    "- **Buffering:** Related to asynchronous interactions, the operating system normally manages buffers to enable data to be transferred to and from the devices to match the performance needs of the device.  We have already seen how memory management creates a massive buffer cache to buffer millions of blocks in memory.  On the other hand, if a program is dumping huge files to a slow character device, the OS needs to buffer the data, and feed it to the device at the rate that the device can handle. \n",

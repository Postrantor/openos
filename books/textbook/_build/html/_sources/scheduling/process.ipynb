    "The key system calls in traditional Unix related to processes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pid = fork(void)`:  Create a child process that is a duplicate of the parent; return 0 in child, and `PID` of child in parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `exit(status)`: Terminate the calling process and record the status passed in for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pid = waitpid(cpid, *status...)`: Wait for specified child process `cpid` to complete (or change state), fill `*status` with the status passed on child's exit, and garbage collect any kernel resources; return the `PID` of the child process that exited (or changed state). \n",
    "\n",
    "- `err = execve(program, arguments, environment)`: executing the file `program` with specified arguments and environment information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fork` system call duplicates the calling process (referred to as the *parent*) into a new *child* process, where the only difference that enables the parent and child to distinguish themself is the return value.  You can think of this logically as creating a copy of all the process memory, copying the CPU state, and copying the file descriptor table (while incrementing reference counts on all the files pointed to by the file descriptor table).   \n",
    "\n",
    "A process has a large amount of state associated with it.  Linux implements `fork` in a library on top of the lower level `clone` call that lets the calling program control what part of the state is copied to the child.  As we will see, this enables the same system call to be used to both create processes, and create threads within those processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fork is usually quickly followed by a call to `exec` to execute a new program.  One of the often claimed *elegant* design decisions of unix is that after a fork, the child has fine grained control to change file descriptor state before calling `exec`; that is, the same functionality that is used for normal access to files is used by the shell between fork and exec to set up he child.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the authors have argued that fork was a clever hack for machines and programs of the 1970s that has long outlived its usefulness and is now a liability {cite}`forkinroad`.  Many operating systems provide powerful primitives to control the launching of new programs without an intervening `fork`, and fork imposes design constraints and overheads that these alternatives don't have.  Even on Linux for many use cases, `posix_spawn` combines the functionality of `fork` and `exec`.  However, `posix_spawn` is on Linux implemented on top of clone, so it doesn't actually alleviate the author's concerns.   \n",

While those of us that wrote the paper still assert `fork` is a poor idea, we will use this opportunity to assert that we much prefer Linux to windows and we are in fact not \"Microsoft stooges\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of these interfaces are actual system calls and are in section 2 of the man pages, others are implemented in a library; you can, for example type `man -k exec` to find out which man pages relate to exec.   If you type `man 3 exec` you will find a whole series of higher level functions built on top of `execve`. \n",

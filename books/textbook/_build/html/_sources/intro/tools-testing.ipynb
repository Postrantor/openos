    "Most students try to solve the complicated programs for this course by implementing them, and then manually testing their program.  This is, possible...., but incredibly challenging.

    "As you develop your program, you are going to write many individual functions.  For each, think about how to write simple tests to see if the function does what you expect it to.  For example, one of the assignments we often hand out is a user level thread scheduler.  To get it to work, you need to set up the stack of the thread properly so that when the thread completes it calls a routine to exit. If you write a simple test at the beginning to test what happens after a thread completes, it will take a few minutes to identify and fix any bugs.  Many students, instead, spend hours trying to identify the problem manually when they have a running scheduler, with timer interrupts causing threads to switch between themselves.  \n",

The first step on developing a parser is to define its interface, and a set of tests against that interface.  To do this, we define the data structures and functions that the parser will expose to its clients in a header file shown in {numref}`myshell_parser_h`.  "

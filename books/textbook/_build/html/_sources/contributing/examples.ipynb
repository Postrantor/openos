You can just download the image to your desktop, edit it there, and upload it again. You can Please use png as the source type of the file, rather than the default drawio; in this case it will create a XXX.drawio.png file, where the diagram is embedded in the png, so you can both dispay it, and edit it. This means you can not only continue to edit the file directly, but can also include exactly the same file in a figure.  \n",

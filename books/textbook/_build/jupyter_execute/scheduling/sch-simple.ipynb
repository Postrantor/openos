    "- **Context switch**: Switching the CPU from running one task to another, i.e., saving the processor registers used by the running task into its thread struc, and loading some other task's registers into the CPU. \n",
    "- **Preemption**: Stopping a task to run another one. \n",
    "- **Response time**: How long does it take for an application to respond to external events.\n",

This policy is called shortest job first, and will always yield the optimal turnaround time. \n",

For such tasks, if we can make sure that CPU intensive tasks don't block I/O intensive ones for too long, the system will enable the I/O intensive ones to better use the I/O devices while the CPU intensive task has only modest impact from the short periods of time that the I/O intensive ones use it.  Also, if a user is interacting with the I/O intensive one, e.g. running emacs, the *Response Time* is less affected by the CPU intensive applications. \n",

When a task starts running it is given a fixed amount of time to run, often called a *Quantum* or *Time slice*.  When the quantum  expires the OS does a context switch to the next task in the queue and adds the previously running task at the back of the queue.  \n",

We have to weigh the cost of changing processes against the interactivity requirements when deciding on the length of a time we will run CPU intensive tasks.  You want to pick a time large enough that you are **amortizing** the cost of a context switch; if you picked a time that was a few hundred computer cycles you would be spending most of your time context switching.   On the other hand, if you it is too long, interactive tasks would get terrible response rate.  \n",
